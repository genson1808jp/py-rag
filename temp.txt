I have the same problem and after digging deep into the problem I post my considerations here and at the footer the link to the official docs.

docker vs docker compose
I you launch the docker run you MUST follow what is written in official elastic docs. In particular the flag -it create a pseudo console necessary to auto-generate the password and enrollment token

If you launch the container with docker-compose.yml the Auto-generated password and enrollment will NOT be generated, (see the GitHub Issue) and is necessary to generate manually with the following commands:

docker exec -ti elastic_container_name /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic
docker exec -ti elastic_container_name /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
If you want a compose file with full setup you must use the official docker-compose file from elastic docs here github here.

If you want a single node, remove EVERYTHINGS regarding node2 and node3

Security
I have noticed (but maybe wrong) that if you use ANY of the security env variables i.e. ELASTIC_PASSWORD or event setting the xpack.security.enabled=true you must set ALL security by hand (certificates, password, and so on).

If you try to remove security with xpack.security.enabled=false kibana doesn't work correctly.

Single node for dev purpose
I post here my solution

docker-compose.yml
version: '3'

services:
  node01:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.8.0
    networks:
      - net1
    ports:
      - 9200:9200
    container_name: es-node01
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
  kibana:
    image: docker.elastic.co/kibana/kibana:8.8.0
    networks:
      - net1
    ports:
      - 5601:5601
    container_name: kib-01
    depends_on: 
      - node01
networks:
  net1:
start with docker compose up -d and wait until all is started.

launch this command to generate (reset) the elastic user password docker exec -ti es-node01 /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic

launch this command to generate the enrollment token docker exec -ti es-node01 /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s kibana
